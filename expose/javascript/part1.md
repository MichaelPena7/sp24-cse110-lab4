1. Line 9 prints "values added: 20"
2. Line 13 prints "final result: 20"
3. Line 9 prints "values added: 20"
4. Line 13 returns an error, because 'result' is not defined. Most likely because the 'result' defined with 'let' in the above if-statement does not reach outside the scope of the if-statement.
5.  Line 9 prints an error, because we are changing the value of an assigned constant variable.
6.  Line 13 prints the same error as Line 9, and therefore has the same explanation as Question 5.
